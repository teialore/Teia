<p class="page-description">Hello everyone :) 

This is my Tinder research. I've always wondered if there is any pattern of my matches and how many people liked me. Well, just so you know, I choose on the settings to show me only guys from 24-32 years old. 
	The experiment was made on a tuesday afternoon of sempeber 2016, in the location of Telefonplan in Stockholm. I liked the first 100 people the app randomly choose. Those are the results that I got back, enjoy! </p>

var data = {
  // A labels array that can contain any sort of values
  labels: ['Mon', 'Tue', 'Wed', 'Thu', 'Fri'],
  // Our series array that contains series objects or in this case series data arrays
  series: [
    [5, 2, 4, 2, 0]
  ]
};

// Create a new line chart object where as first parameter we pass in a selector
// that is resolving to our chart container element. The Second parameter
// is the actual data object.
new Chartist.Line('.ct-chart', data);
