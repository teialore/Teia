<p class="page-description">Hello everyone :) 

This is my Tinder research. I've always wondered if there is any pattern of my matches and how many people liked me. Well, just so you know, I choose on the settings to show me only guys from 24-32 years old. 
	The experiment was made on a tuesday afternoon of sempeber 2016, in the location of Telefonplan in Stockholm. I liked the first 100 people the app randomly choose. Those are the results that I got back, enjoy! </p>

  // A labels array that can contain any sort of values
  labels: ['24', '25', '26', '27', '28' , '29' , '30' , '31' , '32'],
  // Our series array that contains series objects or in this case series data arrays
  series: [
    [14, 9, 13, 7, 10 , 11 , 6 , 3 , 6 ]

// Create a new line chart object where as first parameter we pass in a selector

// is the actual data object.
