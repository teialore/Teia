<p class="page-description">Hello everyone :) 

This is my Tinder research. I've always wondered if there is any pattern of my matches and how many people liked me. Well, just so you know, I choose on the settings to show me only guys from 24-32 years old. 
	The experiment was made on a tuesday afternoon of sempeber 2016, in the location of Telefonplan in Stockholm. I liked the first 100 people the app randomly choose. Those are the results that I got back, enjoy! </p>
